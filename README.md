# Space-Expedition-Heap-Activity
A Heaps Activity in Data Structure and Algorithms

Description: Space Expedition Heap Quest  

In this challenge, participants will embark on an intergalactic journey to manage a fleet of spacecraft using **Heap Data Structures**. The spacecraft are characterized by their **energy levels**, and participants must use heaps to efficiently organize, deploy, and optimize their fleet for various missions.  

Through hands-on tasks, participants will master **Max-Heap** and **Min-Heap** operations, including insertion, deletion, heapify, and heap conversion. Each task is set in a creative scenario to enhance engagement while reinforcing foundational concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms**.  

This activity fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and coding skills while adding a fun and thematic twist to traditional heap challenges.
